# README.md Generator Challenge

## Description
> README.md generated using this generator!

This is Adrian Jimenez's module 9 README.md generator challenge submission. 

I started this project off by first overviewing my knowledge over node.js, and initializing the project with the modules and files I wanted in their proper places. I created an index.js file to host the primary javascript and separated the rest of the functions into separate files for readability. I then proceeded to construct the prompts I wanted the user to see in index.js as separate functions, and imported functions from template.js to format the responses I got from the user into markdown for the README. Once that was complete, I used the file system module from node.js to write a readme file with the formatted text content I'd recieved.
